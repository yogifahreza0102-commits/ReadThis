  Happy:[
"Today feels lighter, and so do you, dedek. Enjoy it. Nggak usah buru-buru ke next thing."
"Happiness looks good on you. Kelihatan dari cara kamu jalan, mikir, sama napas hari ini."
"Smile, dek. This moment is yours. Nggak perlu jelasin ke siapa-siapa."
"You’re allowed to enjoy this joy, dedek. No guilt, okay? You worked for this."
"Let this feeling stay a bit longer. Nggak semua hal baik harus cepet selesai."
"You’re proof, dek, that good things do happen, even after waiting for so long."
"Everything you worked for is slowly making sense now. Piece by piece, dedek."
"This happiness? Earned. Own it. You didn’t come this far for nothing, dek."
"Keep going. Joy’s walking with you, even if the road’s still kinda messy."
"You’re becoming the person you once hoped to be, dedek. Slowly, but surely."
"Pause a bit, dek. This is a moment worth keeping."
"Happiness hides in simple things, like right now. And hey, you noticed it."
"Be thankful for this feeling. It’s life reminding you it can be kind sometimes."
"Your heart feels full ’cause you let it. That takes guts, dek."
"Choose joy. Especially on days you forget you’re allowed to."
"This is a good moment, dedek. No permission needed."
"Happiness found you. Let it stay, no overthinking how long it’ll last."
"Let yourself feel good. You don’t need to ‘deserve’ rest again, okay?"
"Hey dedek, you deserve that smile. It actually suits you."
"Looks like today’s on your side. Take the small win, dek."
"Enjoy the good vibes. You earned them, patience wasn’t easy."
"This happiness? Totally yours. No explanation, no pressure."
"Keep that smile, dedek. You’re allowed to shine today. For real."
],

Sad:[
"It’s okay to feel sad, dedek. You don’t have to be strong all the time, even when the world expects you to be."
"Your feelings are valid, kok. Even when they feel heavy, confusing, or hard to explain."
"You’re not weak for feeling this way, dek. You’re just human, and being human means feeling things deeply."
"Take a deep breath, ya. You’re allowed to slow down, rest, and stop holding everything together for a bit."
"Some days are just harder than others. And if today is one of those days, that doesn’t mean you’re failing."
"You don’t need to explain your sadness to anyone, dedek. It’s okay if only you understand what you’re feeling right now."
"Even if no one sees it, your pain still matters. It deserves kindness and a little gentleness."
"Feeling sad doesn’t mean you’re failing, dek. It just means something really mattered to you."
"This feeling won’t last forever, even if right now it feels endless."
"Little by little is still progress, you know. Even standing still can be part of healing."
"You’ve survived hard days before, dedek. And even if you can’t see it yet, you’ll survive this one too."
"Healing doesn’t mean rushing. Take your time, go at your own pace. It’s okay."
"Sadness is a quiet reminder that your heart still knows how to care deeply, dek."
"It’s okay to sit with your feelings for a while. You don’t have to push them away just yet."
"Rainy days don’t erase the sky. They’re just part of the change, even if it doesn’t feel like it now."
"Your heart is tired, not broken, dedek. And tired hearts are allowed to rest and heal."
"You’re not alone, even when it really feels like you are."
"It’s okay to feel this way, dek. You’re allowed to have heavy days too."
"One moment at a time is enough. You don’t need to see the whole path right now."
"Be gentle with yourself, dedek. You’re doing the best you can with what you have."
"This pain is real, and it matters. It doesn’t need to be compared to anyone else’s."
"Even in sadness, you’re still worthy of love, care, and understanding, dek."
"Tomorrow doesn’t have to be perfect. It just needs to be a little different."
"You don’t have to carry everything today, dedek. Some things can wait."
"Light often comes back quietly, when you least expect it."
],

Angry:[
"It’s okay to feel angry, dedek. Perasaan kamu valid, no need to feel guilty about it."
"Something crossed a line, so yeah… your reaction makes sense. You’re not being dramatic."
"You’re not wrong for feeling this way, dek. Anger is a natural response when you feel hurt or disrespected."
"Anger is a signal, not a failure. It’s telling you that something actually matters to you."
"You’re allowed to feel upset without explaining yourself to anyone. Your feelings are yours."
"Pause for a second, dedek. Take one slow breath in… and let it out. Just breathe."
"This feeling is intense right now, but it won’t last forever. It will soften with time."
"You don’t have to react immediately. Give yourself some space to think first."
"Sometimes silence is stronger than shouting, and honestly, it protects your peace better."
"Breathe first, dek. Decide later. Clarity always comes after emotions settle."
"Your anger is probably protecting something important, your values, your boundaries, your self-respect."
"Responding calmly gives you back control, over the situation and over yourself."
"Not every battle deserves your energy or emotional investment. Choose wisely."
"The fact that you’re angry means you care deeply about something that matters."
"You are stronger than this moment, dedek, even if it feels overwhelming right now."
"Choose peace over proving a point. Your inner calm is more important."
"You can’t control the situation, but you can control your response, that’s real power."
"Staying calm is real strength, dek, and you have it in you."
],

Fear:[
"It’s okay to feel scared right now, dedek, you’re safe kok."
"Fear is just your brain being protective, bukan lagi mau ngatur hidup kamu."
"You don’t have to be brave all at once, dek, just breathe dulu."
"This feeling will pass, even if right now it feels berat banget."
"You’re not weak or lebay for feeling this way."
"Take a slow breath in… hold it bentar… then let it out gently, dedek."
"Look around for a second, dek, name one thing you can see, hear, and feel."
"Right now, this moment is still manageable, pelan-pelan aja."
"Your body might be panicking, tapi kamu masih in control, dedek."
"You’re here, you’re breathing, and that’s already enough kok, dek."
"You’ve felt fear like this before, and look, kamu berhasil lewatinnya."
"Fear doesn’t always mean danger, dedek, sometimes it’s just anxiety doang."
"Even with fear, you can still take one small step aja."
"Courage isn’t about not being scared, it’s moving forward anyway, dek."
"You’re stronger than you think, walau sekarang nggak kerasa."
"Fear can be really loud, dedek, tapi nggak selalu bener."
"Not every thought deserves your attention, some can just lewat."
"This feeling is temporary, dek, meski rasanya lama banget."
"You’re allowed to pause, you’re allowed to rest, santai dulu, dedek."
"Fear doesn’t define who you are, nggak sama sekali."
"Hey, I know you’re scared right now, dedek, but you’re not alone kok."
"It’s okay to be afraid, aku di sini bareng kamu, dek."
"There’s nothing wrong with you for feeling like this, serius."
"You don’t have to figure everything out tonight, dedek."
"You’re safe enough for this moment, yuk breathe bareng."
"Slow down, dek, nggak perlu buru-buru ngelewatin ini."
"Fear can sit with you, tapi dia nggak jadi bos, okay?"
"This moment might feel overwhelming, but it will soften pelan-pelan."
"You don’t have to solve tomorrow today, chill dulu aja."
"That heartbeat is proof that you’re still here, dek."
"Even while shaking, you’re still moving forward, and that’s valid."
"Fear often shows up right before growth, dedek."
"It’s okay to take a break sebelum lanjut lagi."
"You’re allowed to feel scared and still keep going, dek."
"This feeling doesn’t erase your strength, sama sekali nggak."
"Your courage might be quiet, but it’s real, dedek."
"Breathe in slowly, tahan bentar, then breathe out gently."
"You don’t have to understand everything right now, dek."
"Being scared doesn’t mean you’re failing, not at all."
"You’re doing the best you can in this moment, dedek."
"This fear won’t last forever, trust that ya."
"You’re safe enough for now, dek."
"One breath at a time is more than enough kok."
"You’re still in control of your next small step, dedek."
"Fear might be loud, but kamu tetap lebih kuat."
"You’ve survived moments like this before, dek."
"This moment will pass, slowly but surely."

Worried:[
"It’s okay to feel worried, dedek. Kamu nggak harus beresin semuanya sekarang. Some things can wait."
"Tarik napas pelan ya, dek. This moment will pass, even kalau rasanya berat banget sekarang."
"Kamu aman di momen ini. Fokus ke hal yang bisa kamu kontrol dulu, sisanya biarin nanti."
"Dek, kamu pernah ngelewatin hal-hal sulit sebelumnya, bahkan yang dulu kamu pikir nggak bakal sanggup. This is no different."
"Not everything needs an answer today. It’s okay to pause, dedek, and just breathe."
"Kamu nggak sendirian ngerasa kayak gini. Banyak orang juga ngerasain hal yang sama, dan it’s okay."
"Worry means you care, dek. Dan caring itu bukan kelemahan, walau kadang rasanya capek."
"Pelan-pelan aja, dedek. One small step is more than enough for today."
"Even slow progress is still progress. Kamu tetap jalan, meskipun pelan dan sunyi."
"Pause bentar ya. Tarik napas 4 detik, tahan 4, hembusin 6. Let your body chill."
"Coba sebutin 3 hal yang kamu lihat, 2 yang bisa kamu sentuh, 1 yang kamu dengar. Balik ke sini ya, dek."
"Right now, fokus ke ‘next right thing’ aja. Nggak perlu mikirin masa depan jauh-jauh."
"Perasaan ini bakal lewat, dedek. It always does, walaupun sekarang rasanya lama banget."
"Breathe. You’re okay in this moment. Seriously, kamu doing better than you think."
"Satu langkah aja cukup buat hari ini, dek. Kamu nggak dituntut lebih dari itu."
"Kamu nggak harus punya semua jawaban sekarang. Clarity usually comes later, not instantly."
"Hey, dedek, it’s okay to feel like this. Be gentle with yourself, kamu boleh capek."
"Kamu sudah ngelakuin yang terbaik dengan apa yang kamu punya. And that’s enough, dek."
"Pelan dikit nggak apa-apa. Kamu boleh istirahat tanpa harus ngerasa bersalah."
],

Regret:[
"Dedek, you did the best you could with what you knew back then. That effort still counts, even now."
"Regret itu tanda kamu tumbuh, dek. Old you nggak tahu apa yang new you tahu sekarang, and that growth wasn’t free."
"It’s okay to feel this, dedek. Healing nggak harus buru-buru atau pura-pura kuat."
"Mistakes don’t erase your worth, dek. Niat baik kamu dulu tetap valid."
"Some choices still hurt when you remember them, and that pain doesn’t make you weak, dedek. It means you cared."
"You can’t rewrite the past, dek, but you can learn and choose differently moving forward."
"Regret datang karena sesuatu itu mattered to your heart, dedek."
"It hurts because it mattered, dek, and that meaning is still real."
"Let this feeling guide you toward understanding, dedek, not punish you over and over."
"What you regret today can slowly turn into wisdom, dek, shaping a kinder future."
"Every regret carries a lesson, dedek. You don’t have to keep the pain just to remember the lesson."
"Growth often starts with discomfort, dek, and this discomfort means you’re changing."
"Forgiving yourself is part of moving on, dedek. You deserve that too."
"You are more than your worst decision, dek. Your story is way bigger than one moment."
"You’re allowed to give yourself another chance, dedek, even if you don’t feel ready yet."
"Be kind to yourself, dek. You’re still learning how to live and figure things out."
"Regret is proof of growth, dedek, not a life sentence."
"You’re not late, dek. You’re learning at your own pace, and that pace is okay."
"One mistake doesn’t define a whole life, dedek. It’s just one chapter."
"This moment isn’t the end, dek. It’s just a pause before something new."
"Take a breath, dedek. You’re still here, and that means there’s still room to grow."
"Tomorrow doesn’t need yesterday’s weight, dek. You’re allowed to put it down."
"Healing starts with understanding, not self-blame, dedek. You can choose understanding today."
"You’re allowed to move forward, dek, sambil tetap bawa pelajaran dari masa lalu, not the pain."

Lonely:[
"You matter more than you realize, dek. Keberadaan kamu punya arti, jauh lebih besar dari momen ini."
"Feeling lonely doesn’t mean you’re unloved, kadang itu cuma tanda kamu pengen koneksi yang lebih dalam."
"This feeling will pass, dedek. Kamu udah survive banyak hal sebelumnya, yang ini juga."
"Kamu boleh ngerasa kayak gini, dek. Healing nggak punya deadline."
"Someone out there would miss you deeply, even if you can’t see it yet."
"Loneliness is just a phase, dek, bukan identitas kamu."
"You are enough, even di hari-hari sepi yang rasanya slow banget."
"It’s okay to pause here for a bit, dedek. Kamu nggak harus punya semua jawaban sekarang."
"You don’t have to be strong today, dek. Cukup bernapas aja udah cukup."
"Your presence still has value, even when you feel unseen or unheard."
"Being alone doesn’t mean being forgotten, dedek. Sometimes it’s just a quiet break."
"This isn’t the end of your story, dek. Ini cuma chapter yang lagi sunyi."
"You’re still worthy of connection, care, and understanding, exactly as you are."
"Stay, breathe, dedek. Kamu jauh lebih berarti dari rasa berat ini."
"It’s okay if today feels heavy, dek. Ada hari yang memang harus dipeluk pelan-pelan."
"You’re doing the best you can, even if dari luar kelihatannya biasa aja."
"Not every silence is rejection, dek. Banyak orang juga lagi berantem sama pikirannya sendiri."
"Kamu boleh butuh orang lain, dedek. Needing connection doesn’t make you weak."
"Your heart isn’t broken, dek. It’s just tired from carrying too much."
"You’re still growing, even saat lagi ngerasa stuck dan sendirian."
"You don’t have to rush healing, dedek. Pelan-pelan juga nggak apa-apa."
"This quiet moment won’t last forever. Change sometimes datang pelan."
"You’re not hard to love, dedek. Kamu cuma nunggu love yang tepat."
"Loneliness doesn’t define your worth, it only shows you care about connection."
"It’s okay to miss being understood, dek. Itu tanda hati kamu dalam."
"You are allowed to take up space, even when you feel small."
"Your story is still unfolding, dek. Chapter ini nggak nentuin ending-nya."
"You deserve warmth and connection, sama kayak siapa pun."
"You’re not behind in life, dek. Everyone has their own timeline."
"Even when you’re alone, you still matter."
"It’s okay to feel empty sometimes, dedek. Emptiness bisa jadi ruang buat hal baru."
"You’re not asking for too much, dek. Connection itu kebutuhan manusia."
"Someone will hear you, dedek. Suara kamu nggak ditakdirkan hilang."
"Your feelings are valid, even if not everyone understands them."
"You don’t have to go through this alone, walau rasanya sekarang begitu."
"Better days are coming, dek, pelan tapi nyata."
"You are worthy of care, kindness, and gentleness."
"You’re still seen, dedek, even when you feel invisible."
"This feeling will soften, like all the heavy ones before."
"You are not forgotten, dek. Keberadaan kamu ninggalin jejak."
"You are allowed to hope again, even after disappointment."
"You belong, dedek, meski saat ini rasanya nggak."
"Your existence is meaningful, simply because you’re here."
"You are more loved than you think, dedek. Sometimes love is just quiet."
