"It’s okay to feel sad. You don’t have to be strong all the time, even when the world expects you to be.",
"Your feelings are valid, even when they feel heavy, confusing, or hard to explain.",
"You’re not weak for feeling this way. You’re human, and being human means feeling deeply.",

Angry:[

"Something crossed a line, and your reaction makes sense given what you experienced.",
"You are not wrong for feeling this way. Anger is a natural response to being hurt or disrespected.",
"Anger is a signal, not a failure. It is trying to tell you that something matters to you.",
"You are allowed to feel upset without having to justify it to anyone.",
"Pause. Take one slow breath in and let it out to ground yourself.",
"This feeling is intense right now, but it will soften with time.",
"You do not have to react immediately. Give yourself space to think.",
"Silence can be stronger than shouting and often protects your peace.",
"Breathe first. Decide later. When emotions settle, clarity follows.",

"Your anger shows you care deeply about something that matters.",
"You are stronger than this moment, even if it feels overwhelming now.",

"Right now, this moment is manageable.",
"Your body is reacting, but you are in control.",
"You are here. You are breathing. That is enough.",
"You have faced fear before, and you survived.",
"Fear does not mean danger, it means awareness.",
"Even with fear, you can take one small step.",
"Courage isn’t the absence of fear; it’s moving forward with it.",
"You are stronger than this moment.",
"Fear speaks loudly, but it doesn’t speak truth.",
"Not every thought deserves your belief.",
"This feeling is temporary, even if it feels endless.",
"You are allowed to pause. You are allowed to rest.",
"Fear doesn’t define who you are.",
"Hey, I know you’re scared right now, but you’re not facing this alone.",

Worried:[
"It’s okay to feel worried. You don’t have to solve everything right now. Not everything needs an answer today.",
"Take a deep breath. This moment will pass, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet. You’ve survived moments like this before.",
"You are safe in this moment. Focus on what you can control, and let the rest wait.",
"You’ve handled difficult things before, even the ones you thought you couldn’t. This is no different.",
"Not everything needs an answer today. Give yourself permission to pause and breathe.",
"You’re not alone in feeling this way. Many people feel this, and it doesn’t mean something is wrong with you.",
"Worry means you care, and caring is a strength, even when it feels heavy.",
"One small step at a time is more than enough. You don’t need to see the whole path yet.",
"Even slow progress is still progress. You’re moving, even if it feels quiet.",
"Pause. Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, breathe out for 6. Let your body settle.",
"Name 3 things you can see, 2 things you can touch, 1 thing you can hear. Bring yourself back here.",
"Right now, just focus on the next right thing, not the whole future.",
"This feeling will pass. It always does, even when it feels endless.",
"Breathe. You’re okay in this moment. You’re doing better than you think.",
"One step at a time is enough for today. You don’t need more than that.",
"You don’t need all the answers now. Clarity often comes later, not instantly.",
"Hey, it’s okay to feel like this. Be kind to yourself, you’re allowed to struggle.",
"You’re doing the best you can with what you have, and that is enough.",
"Slow down a bit. You’re allowed to rest without feeling guilty."
],

Regret:[
"You did the best you could with what you knew at the time, and that effort still matters.",
"Regret means you’ve grown, the old you didn’t know what the new you knows, and that growth didn’t come for free.",
"It’s okay to feel this. Healing doesn’t require rushing or forcing yourself to be okay too soon.",
"Mistakes don’t erase your worth or the good intentions you once carried.",
"Some choices still hurt when we remember them, and that pain doesn’t make you weak, it means you cared deeply.",
"You can’t rewrite the past, but you’re allowed to learn from it and choose differently moving forward.",
"Regret visits when we care deeply about something that mattered to our heart.",
"It hurts because it mattered, and that meaning is still valid.",
"Let this feeling guide you toward understanding, not punish you endlessly.",
"What you regret today can slowly become wisdom that shapes a kinder future.",
"Every regret carries a lesson, you don’t have to carry the pain forever to keep the lesson.",

"Forgiving yourself is part of moving forward, and you deserve that forgiveness too.",
"You are more than your worst decision, and your story is bigger than one moment.",
"You’re allowed to give yourself another chance, even if you don’t feel ready yet.",
"Be kind to yourself, you’re still learning how to live and make sense of things.",
"Regret is proof of growth, not a life sentence.",
"You’re not late. You’re learning at your own pace, and that pace is valid.",
"One mistake doesn’t define a life, it’s only one chapter in a long story.",
"This moment is not the end, it’s a pause before something new.",
"Take a breath. You’re still here, and that means there is still room to grow.",
"Tomorrow doesn’t need yesterday’s weight, you’re allowed to put it down.",
"Healing starts with understanding, not blame, and you are allowed to choose understanding today.",
"You’re allowed to move forward, even while carrying lessons from the past."
],

Lonely:[
"You are not invisible, every part of your presence matters even when no one seems to notice.",
"You matter more than you think, your existence carries meaning far beyond this moment.",
"Feeling lonely doesn’t mean you are unloved, sometimes it simply means you are longing for deeper connection.",
"This feeling will pass, even if it doesn’t feel like it now, just like many difficult moments you have survived before.",
"You are allowed to feel this way, there is no deadline for healing or understanding your emotions.",
"Someone out there would miss you deeply, even if you don’t see their impact in your life yet.",

"Not every silence means rejection, sometimes people are fighting their own quiet battles.",
"You are allowed to need others, needing connection does not make you weak.",
"Your heart is not broken, it’s tired from carrying too much for too long.",
"You are still growing, even in loneliness, even in moments that feel stuck.",
